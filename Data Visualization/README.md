# Data Visualization Project: Open Food Facts Products

## Overview
This project demonstrates expert-level data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using Python. I worked with a large real-world dataset of food products and their nutritional information, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/openfoodfacts/world-food-facts).

## Data Source
- The data was obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/openfoodfacts/world-food-facts
- The file used: `products.tsv`

## Key Steps
1. **Data Loading:** Loaded a sample of the large dataset for efficient analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Selected relevant features for analysis and visualization.
   - Converted data types and handled missing values.
   - Removed outliers and imputed missing values for robust analysis.
   - Created new features for classification (e.g., high/low energy class).
3. **Visualization:**
   - Explored the distribution of energy content.
   - Analyzed pairwise relationships between nutrients, including classification labels.
   - Compared average energy content across top product categories.
   - Visualized the geographic distribution of products.
   - Used advanced visualizations such as parallel coordinates for multivariate analysis.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Advanced data cleaning and feature engineering
- Outlier detection and imputation
- Exploratory data analysis
- Expert-level data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn
- Preparation of data for classification tasks

## Notebook Location
All code and visualizations are in `main.ipynb` in this folder.
